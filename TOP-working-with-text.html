    <h1><strong>Hello World!</strong></h1>
    
        <p>There have been many website built over the course of many years, but this is my first attempt at coding my very own <strong>HTML</strong></p>

        <P>I <em>believe</em> I can do this and I am excited to learn and to practice as much as I can to become a developer. I know that age is slightly against me, but that is really only a mindset.</P>
        <h2>My First Examples</h2>
        <p>This is really the first examples I will be compiling with any seriousness. I have dabbled with html in sites like myspcae and even ebay years ago, but never really took the time to learn the foundations of what I was doing.</p>
        <p>Thanks so much to myself for allowing myself the time to learn this powerful set of skills and I will see <b>myself</b> out!</p>
